\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
One might decide to have a unit test for every public API.

That is the idea of this folder. A one to one unit test per public API at minimum.

Whether every public API will be done or not is being decided upon. But, perhaps that wording illustrates the purpose of this folder.

Ideas\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Automate test heatmap... If a C\# compiler service could identify all publically scoped API, it could verify if after the basis was ran whether all public API was used.
\item Visualize the "{}basis"{}... so one could look at a given release of \doxylink{namespace_luthetus_1_1_ide}{Luthetus.\+Ide} and then bring up the "{}\+Unit\+Tests-\/\+Basis-\/\+Visualization"{} for that given release.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Draw a graph of all public API references.
\item Color the connection green if no exception occurred.
\item Color the connection red if an exception occurred.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Automate test generation...
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Try any meaningful arguments, automatically as their own test cast. Ex\+: a method which accepts an \textquotesingle{}int\textquotesingle{}. One could decide that meaningful arguments are \mbox{[} Int.\+Min, -\/2, -\/1, 0, 1, 2 Int.\+Max \mbox{]}
\item Concerns\+: could automated test cases result in bad outcomes? I.\+e. somehow the test case does bank.\+Withdraw(Int.\+Max). As per the concern, none of this automation exists at the moment.
