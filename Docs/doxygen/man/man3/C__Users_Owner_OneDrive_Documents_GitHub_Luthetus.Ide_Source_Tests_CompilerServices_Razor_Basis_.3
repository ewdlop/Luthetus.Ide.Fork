Source/Tests/CompilerServices/Razor/Basis Directory Reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.PP
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
One might decide to have a unit test for every public API\&.

.PP
That is the idea of this folder\&. A one to one unit test per public API at minimum\&.

.PP
Whether every public API will be done or not is being decided upon\&. But, perhaps that wording illustrates the purpose of this folder\&.

.PP
Ideas:

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Automate test heatmap\&.\&.\&. If a C# compiler service could identify all publically scoped API, it could verify if after the basis was ran whether all public API was used\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Visualize the "basis"\&.\&.\&. so one could look at a given release of \fBLuthetus\&.Ide\fP and then bring up the "UnitTests-Basis-Visualization" for that given release\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Draw a graph of all public API references\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Color the connection green if no exception occurred\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Color the connection red if an exception occurred\&.
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Automate test generation\&.\&.\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Try any meaningful arguments, automatically as their own test cast\&. Ex: a method which accepts an 'int'\&. One could decide that meaningful arguments are [ Int\&.Min, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 Int\&.Max ]
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Concerns: could automated test cases result in bad outcomes? I\&.e\&. somehow the test case does bank\&.Withdraw(Int\&.Max)\&. As per the concern, none of this automation exists at the moment\&.
