Fix: deletion of lines will now scroll by the amount of lines deleted\&. Previously, this was breaking the virtualization result until one triggered a re-calculation\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix: Keybinds first try to match on a JavaScript 'event\&.key' so to speak\&. Then, as a fallback they will now try to match on 'event\&.code' so to speak\&. Previously, on Ubuntu, if one remapped the CapsLock key to Escape, it would not work in the IDE at various places\&. This has been fixed\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Text editor events now use structs to transmit event data\&. This is expected to be a large optimization, as it tends that high turnover 'class' objects bring performance issues due to the garbage collection overhead\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Text editor's OnKeyDownLateBatching event uses a fixed size array for batching events, rather than what previously was a List<T>\&. This is expected to be a large optimization, as it tends that high turnover 'class' objects bring performance issues due to the garbage collection overhead\&. As well, it tends to be the case that no more than 3 or 4 keyboard events ever get batched together\&. So the fixed size array is '8' keyboard events can be made into a single batch\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Use more recent dropdown code for text editor autocomplete and context menu\&. The newer dropdown code moves itself so it stays on screen (if it initially rendered offscreen)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix: return focus to text editor after picking a menu option in autocomplete or context menu\&.

Text Editor "feels" an order of magnitude faster after various Blazor optimizations and struct/array optimizations (which reduce the garbage collection overhead thus improving performance greatly)\&.

If one opens the text editor's context menu with the dedicated 'ContextMenu' button on the keyboard, or the accessability keybind { Shift + F10 }\&. To then hit the 'Escape' key or the 'ArrowLeft' key to close the context menu, is causing an unhandled exception\&.

The syntax highlighting is out of sync\&. (its seems to be "lagging" behind by 1 event)
