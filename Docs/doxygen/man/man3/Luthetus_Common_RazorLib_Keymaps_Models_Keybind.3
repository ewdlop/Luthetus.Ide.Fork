Luthetus.Common.RazorLib.Keymaps.Models.Keybind \- The idea behind this class is entirely based on the 'event\&.key' vs 'event\&.code' for a given keyboard event\&. It is desired to use the 'event\&.key' sometimes, whereas other times the 'event\&.code'\&. So, these corresponding properties on this type were made nullable\&. It still is incredibly clumsy because the goal is that 1 of them isn't null, yet both will forever be "nullable"\&.

The idea behind this class is entirely based on the 'event\&.key' vs 'event\&.code' for a given keyboard event\&. It is desired to use the 'event\&.key' sometimes, whereas other times the 'event\&.code'\&. So, these corresponding properties on this type were made nullable\&. It still is incredibly clumsy because the goal is that 1 of them isn't null, yet both will forever be "nullable"\&. 

Most of this type is the copy and pasted source code of 'KeyboardEventArgs\&.cs' https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/3f1acb59718cadf111a0a796681e3d3509bb3381/src/Components/Web/src/Web/KeyboardEventArgs.cs

.PP
The difference being that the copy and pasted code was changed to be nullable and immutable, and some extra code was added\&.
