'Find All' tool shows results in a tree view\&. As well, it shows multiple results per file, preview text for each result, and moves cursor to the respective result within the file\&.

'@onkeydown="EventUtil\&.AsNonRenderingEventHandler<KeyboardEventArgs>(ReceiveOnKeyDown)"' This avoids unnecessary rendering due to implicit state has changed in the Blazor events\&. Note: the exact version this was added in is uncertain\&. It was recent though\&.

Breadth first C# parser (used to be depth first)\&. This lets the parser see same scope definitions that occur below in the text, relative to where its being referenced from\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Re-written undo/redo\&. In short, only changes are tracked now\&. Whereas previously a copy of the entire file was being stored\&.

Various text editor optimizations\&. One of which is not to re-calculate the virtualization result if the user's action did not cause an edit\&. In otherwords, any movement keys for the cursor won't re-calculate the virtualization result\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Enqueueing a background task is a "synchronous" method, (it used to be async)\&.

Optimization: scrolling can be done to a C# model with IEditContext\&. This is a massive optimization, instead of every change to the text editor scrollbar invoking JavaScript interop to set the scrollbar, the IEditContext will gather many events that ask to modify the scrollbar, and batch them into a single JavaScript interop call to set the scrollbar\&.

Change: Re-write \fBThrottleAsync\&.cs\fP

Change: A lot of synchronous UI code was re-written to be async\&. The goal is that all UI code should be async from top to bottom (generally speaking)\&.

Batch terminal output\&. (this is a massive performance improvement, instead of writing line by line, if many lines of output need to be written, they all are written in one operation\&.)
.IP "\(bu" 2
Parse the output of the terminal on a 'by-command-basis'\&. One can run 'dotnet run' with a \&.net cli output parser, then run 'git status' with a git cli output parser, as an example\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Git integration progress\&. For example, a button that runs "git status", parses the terminal output, and creates a tree view of all the changed files\&. The git integration is still in progress though\&. (more usage of the '\&.git' folder instead of just parsing the terminal so much is likely a path to take)\&.

PolymorphicTabDisplay\&.razor\&.cs (2024-03-15: renamed to \fBTabDisplay\&.razor\&.cs\fP and moved) PolymorphicUi has been started\&. One can see it in action by dragging a text editor tab off of the editor, and then letting go\&. This will turn that tab into a dialog\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
ThrottleController\&.cs has been started\&. All UI events are passed through the same throttle\&. Furthermore, each UI event can specify its own throttle delay, while maintaining the execution by order in which the UI events occurred\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
ThrottleEventOnKeyDown\&.cs Text Editor event batching\&. By way of the previously mentioned ThrottleController, consecutive UI events which are batchable with one another\&. Will merge into a batch event\&. For example, if 20 onkeydown events are waiting in the throttle controller, then 1 onkeydownBatch event will occur which contains all 20 onkeydown events\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBSolutionExplorerContextMenu\&.razor\&.cs\fP: Solution Explorer multi-select context menu options\&. If one selects many files/directories, then the 'delete' context menu option will be available\&. This option will delete all the selected files/directories\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
WASM Performance issues: with this update it seems I introduced a UI thread blockage\&. Holding down any key while typing in the text editor will freeze the UI as a result (more or less) until one lets go\&. I wanted to fix this issue before updating the website, but there are so many vital changes in this update, that I want to make them known\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Native IDE Performance issues: I find any file with more than 10,000 characters in it is a bit laggy\&. I'm still able to myself, use the IDE to develop the IDE, but large files aren't too great of an experience at the moment\&. I wrote partitioning for text editor content in chunks of 4,096 characters\&. But, still there are many more optimizations I have planned for large files optimization\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
'BackgroundTasks' dialog shows all the background tasks that the IDE is performing, as they happen\&. For example, open the dialog, move it so you can see the text editor, then click and drag your cursor within the text editor\&. Each on mouse move event fires a 'BackgroundTask' named "te_HandleContentOnMouseMove"
.IP "\(bu" 2
Progress with debugger integration 'IntegratedTerminalDisplay\&.razor\&.cs'\&. This component came about because, after attaching to a process ID with \fRgithub: Samsung/netcoredbg\fP I wanted to use the CLI to give commands, like a command to put a breakpoint for example\&. But when running netcoredbg, the program immediately would return, as opposed to reading user input\&. I wrote a simple C program that prompts the user for their name\&. When the C program then tries to read standard input, they await a SemaphoreSlim, and an input HTML element gets rendered\&. Once the input HTML element receives an 'Enter' keystroke, the standard input is set as the HTML element value, and the SemaphoreSlim is released by the UI thread\&. Then the CLI program reads standard input\&.

Fix the IDE freezing "randomly": I wrote the \fRThrottle\&.cs\fP initially as async\&. But if the source that wants to be throttled awaits the throttle timer, its just sort of nonsense, right? I believe this was locking\&. Now its a fire and forget, so the invoker doesn't have to await the throttle\&.
