.PP 
This class is a hack and was made on (2024-03-09)\&.
.br

.br
\&. 

The reason for this class: This same hack existed prior, but as value type properties that were on the \fBTextEditorViewModel\fP\&.
.br

.br

.PP
The \fBTextEditorViewModel\fP is an immutable type\&.
.br

.br

.PP
Originally the value type properties were added to \fBTextEditorViewModel\fP as a hack to permit the UI to mark the cursor as being 'within view', but not trigger a re-render\&.
.br

.br

.PP
But, since \fBTextEditorViewModel\fP is immutable, this hack was unreliable\&. At times, the value type that was changed, was from an out of date view model\&. And as result had no effect\&.
.br

.br

.PP
By object-boxing the value types, the hack is more reliable\&.
