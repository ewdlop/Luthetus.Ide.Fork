.PP
How much concern should be given to the text editor changing between the time that the context menu option was generated, and this function is invoked? If the { Ctrl + Period } keybind is hit when the cursor is at positionIndex 30\&. But then 100 characters of text was inserted at positionIndex 0, by the time this function gets access to the text editor, anything the menu option tells this function will be wrong by 100 position indices\&.

.PP
Preferably, long term, 100% concern should be given to the text editor changing between the time that the context menu option was generated, and this function is invoked\&.

.PP
But, in terms of progressively approaching that goal, how should this be handled?
