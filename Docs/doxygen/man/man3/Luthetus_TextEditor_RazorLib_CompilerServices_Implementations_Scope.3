.PP
This is believed to be far better than a \fBISyntaxNode\fP having a pointer to its parent\&. (i\&.e\&.: with this the \fBNodes\fP can be left as a singly linked tree\&.)

.PP
Then, one can query the IBinder to determine what the active scope is given a positionIndex within a file, or etc\&.\&.\&.

.PP
This scope struct then acts as an index into the compilation unit's node tree\&.

.PP
If a scope contains 100 nodes, then 100 pointers would have previously been needed due to 1 per node\&.

.PP
By having the '\fBScope\fP' contain a pointer to a node, the same example only requires 1 pointer to the node that created the scope\&.

.PP
From there, traversal down the tree is done with \fBISyntaxNode\&.GetChildList()\fP;

.PP
Traversal up the tree is done by reading from the IBinderSession inside the IBinderSession\&.ScopeList at index \fBParentIndexKey\fP\&.

.PP
This tells you the node that owns the parent scope\&.

.PP
If it turns out that this is too cumbersome to use in practice then perhaps a different solution should be considered\&.

.PP
All scopes in a file are stored in a flat list, grouped by the ResourceUri they were found in\&. Everytime a scope is instantiated, it gets an incrementing counter as its IndexKey (which is equal to the index it was inserted at\&.\&.\&. 'list\&.Count')\&. Therefore, to go to the parent scope: 'var parentScope = list[ParentIndexKey]' To get "yourself": 'var selfScope = list[IndexKey]'

.PP
Every time the file is parsed the counter resets to 0\&.

.PP
In the future there should be optimizations that don't reparse the entire file, but instead only the scopes that need to be re-parsed given the change made\&.

.PP
This shouldn't be an issue beyond integer overflow\&. And to in the future solve the integer overflow, in the rare case that someone parses int\&.MaxValue number of scopes in a singular C# ResourceUri they likely don't actually have that many scopes in the file, but instead hit that number due to the future optimization that wasn't reseting the counter\&. Then that would trigger a counter reset to 0, and the entire file would have to be reparsed for that edge case\&.

.PP
If a file needs int\&.MaxValue number of scopes during a fresh parse with the counter starting at 0, then I presume this code will throw an exception\&.

.PP
But wouldn't it just the same do so with the previous code once the list of scopes hit a count > int\&.MaxValue?

.PP
If it turns out that int\&.MaxValue is an issue, the storage of scopes needs to be re-worked\&. But it isn't expected to be the case\&.

.PP
Side note: in order to avoid race conditions involving out dated data, should the list itself have an int associated with it, that the \fBIScope\&.cs\fP has as a property, so it can verify that the "batch id" is the same\&.
