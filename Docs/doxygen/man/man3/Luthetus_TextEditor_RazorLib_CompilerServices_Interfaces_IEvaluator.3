.SH NAME
Luthetus.TextEditor.RazorLib.CompilerServices.Interfaces.IEvaluator \- The ILuthCompilerService is to only perform static analysis of source code\&. 
.br

.br
 One should never execute the source code which is being analyzed\&. 
.br

.br
 However, for testing purposes it can be useful to see if one's logic for parsing expressions evaluates properly\&. And so, for testing only, the \fBIEvaluator\fP exists\&. 
.br

.br
 Again, the ILuthCompilerService should NEVER execute source code which it is analyzing\&. Only perform static analysis of source code\&.
