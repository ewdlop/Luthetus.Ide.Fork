Luthetus.TextEditor.RazorLib.TextEditors.Models.Internals.SaveFileHelper \- TODO: (2023-06-09) This class is a hacky way to track a cancellation token source per each text editor model\&. As of this comment, \fBTextEditorModel\fP is a class which is frequently re-constructed with new()\&. A CancellationTokenSource as a property would therefore not work\&. One would Cancel() then new() up another CancellationTokenSource and update the property\&. Yet its possible that instance of \fBTextEditorModel\fP isn't even being used anymore by that point\&. So a readonly object wrapper which then contains the CancellationTokenSource ensures it doesn't get lost\&.
